# The LANLord
## an adapted LTSP server for hosting LAN parties

Mostly just a bunch of bash scripts for copying/backing up relevant desktop settings/game settings/wine prefixes for multiple users

Note: everything listed here was made with my specific server in mind, and isn't really useful for deploying in a standard way to different setups yet
